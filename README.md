# Planetary Age Calculator

#### This program will calculate a user's age as if they lived on other planets (for example, the user's age in Mars or Venus years), based upon the birthdate the user enters. The program will also deliver a user's life expectancy in other planet-years.

## Technologies Used

* Javascript
* HTML
* Lint
* Webpack
* CSS
* npm

## The user inputs their date of birth into the form.  The program then calculates the user's current Earth-age. Then, the program calculates the user's age as if they lived on Mercury, Venus, Mars & Jupiter.

## The program also calculates the user's life expectancy based upon input from the user, and returns the user's remaining life expectency on Mercury, Venus, Mars & Jupiter.

## If the user has lived longer than their life expectancy, the page will return the number of years they have lived beyond the equivalent expectancy on each planet.
